# SARS-COV-2-omicron variant

*Omicron variant mapped against the original wuhan genome*
Genome: NC_045512.2 - sars-cov-2_wuhan_genome_NC_045512.2.fasta (29,903 bp)
Sequencing reads: SRR17309642 (paired reads, 10MB total)

The original read files were concatenated with `head` (22X reduction in depth)
to reduce the output BAM file to 450KB. So it still covers the whole genome,
just with reduced depth.
